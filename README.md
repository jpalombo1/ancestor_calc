# Ancestor Calc

Based on this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fm0hOex4psA


Basic job is to how many generations it takes to get a common ancestor


Thoeretical answer is log2(N) as we see if we approach that using Monte Carlo Analysis and random generation of parents to children recursively up generations until we hit a common ancestor that is related to all kids of the latest generation.
